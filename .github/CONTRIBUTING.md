## Local Development Setup

To set up your local development environment:

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

Docker provides a consistent development environment with all dependencies pre-configured.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sim.git
   cd sim
   ```

2. **Start the Docker Environment:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   Or use the convenience script which handles environment setup and migrations:

   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/start_simstudio_docker.sh
   ./scripts/start_simstudio_docker.sh
   ```

   This will:

   - Start a PostgreSQL database container
   - Build and run the Next.js application with hot-reloading
   - Set up all necessary environment variables
   - Apply database migrations automatically

3. **View Logs:**

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f simstudio
   ```

4. **Make Your Changes:**
   - Edit files in your local directory
   - Changes will be automatically reflected thanks to hot-reloading

### Option 2: Using VS Code / Cursor Dev Containers

Dev Containers provide a consistent and easy-to-use development environment:

1. **Prerequisites:**

   - Use the provided aliases (like `sim-start`) to run common commands
   - Your changes will be automatically hot-reloaded

4. **GitHub Codespaces:**
   - This setup also works with GitHub Codespaces if you prefer development in the browser
   - Just click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace on main"

### Option 3: Manual Setup

If you prefer not to use Docker or Dev Containers:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sim.git
   cd sim/sim
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Using NPM:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment:**

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Configure database connection and other required authentication variables

4. **Set Up Database:**

   - You need a PostgreSQL instance running
   - Run migrations:
     ```bash
     npm run db:push
     ```

5. **Run the Development Server:**

   - With NPM:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

6. **Make Your Changes and Test Locally.**

### Email Template Development

When working on email templates, you can preview them using a local email preview server:

1. **Run the Email Preview Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run email:dev
   ```

2. **Access the Preview:**

   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
   - You'll see a list of all email templates
   - Click on any template to view and test it with various parameters

3. **Templates Location:**
   - Email templates are located in `sim/app/emails/`
   - After making changes to templates, they will automatically update in the preview

## Adding New Blocks and Tools

Sim Studio is built in a modular fashion where blocks and tools extend the platform's functionality. To maintain consistency and quality, please follow the guidelines below when adding a new block or tool.

### Where to Add Your Code

- **Blocks:** Create your new block file under the `/sim/blocks/blocks` directory. The name of the file should match the provider name (e.g., `pinecone.ts`).
- **Tools:** Create a new directory under `/sim/tools` with the same name as the provider (e.g., `/sim/tools/pinecone`).

In addition, you will need to update the registries:

- **Block Registry:** Update the blocks index (`/sim/blocks/index.ts`) to include your new block.
- **Tool Registry:** Update the tools registry (`/sim/tools/index.ts`) to add your new tool.

### How to Create a New Block

1. **Create a New File:**  
   Create a file for your block named after the provider (e.g., `pinecone.ts`) in the `/sim/blocks/blocks` directory.

2. **Create a New Icon:**
   Create a new icon for your block in the `/sim/components/icons.tsx` file. The icon should follow the same naming convention as the block (e.g., `PineconeIcon`).

3. **Define the Block Configuration:**  
   Your block should export a constant of type `BlockConfig`. For example:

   ```typescript:/sim/blocks/blocks/pinecone.ts
   import { PineconeIcon } from '@/components/icons'
   import { PineconeResponse } from '@/tools/pinecone/types'
   import { BlockConfig } from '../types'

   export const PineconeBlock: BlockConfig<PineconeResponse> = {
     type: 'pinecone',
     name: 'Pinecone',
     description: 'Use Pinecone vector database',
     longDescription: 'A more detailed description of what this block does and how to use it.',
     category: 'tools',
     bgColor: '#123456',
     icon: PineconeIcon,

     // If this block requires OAuth authentication
     provider: 'pinecone',

     // Define subBlocks for the UI configuration
     subBlocks: [
       // Block configuration options
     ],
   }
   ```

4. **Register Your Block:**  
   Import and add your block to the blocks registry (`/sim/blocks/index.ts`) in the appropriate index file so it appears in the workflow builder.

   ```typescript:/sim/blocks/index.ts
   import { PineconeBlock } from './blocks/pinecone'

   export const blocks = [
     // ... existing blocks
     PineconeBlock,
   ]

   export const blocksByType: Record<string, BlockConfig> = {
     // ... existing blocks by type
     pinecone: PineconeBlock,
   }
   ```

5. **Test Your Block:**  
   Ensure that the block displays correctly in the UI and that its functionality works as expected.

### How to Create a New Tool

1. **Create a New Directory:**  
   Create a directory under `/sim/tools` with the same name as the provider (e.g., `/sim/tools/pinecone`).

2. **Create Tool Files:**  
   Create separate files for each tool functionality with descriptive names (e.g., `fetch.ts`, `generate_embeddings.ts`, `search_text.ts`) in your tool directory.

3. **Create a Types File:**  
   Create a `types.ts` file in your tool directory to define and export all types related to your tools.

4. **Create an Index File:**  
   Create an `index.ts` file in your tool directory that imports and exports all tools:

   ```typescript:/sim/tools/pinecone/index.ts
   import { fetchTool } from './fetch'
   import { generateEmbeddingsTool } from './generate_embeddings'
   import { searchTextTool } from './search_text'

   export { fetchTool, generateEmbeddingsTool, searchTextTool }
   ```

5. **Define the Tool Configuration:**  
   Your tool should export a constant with a naming convention of `{toolName}Tool`. The tool ID should follow the format `{provider}_{tool_name}`. For example:

   ```typescript:/sim/tools/pinecone/fetch.ts
   import { ToolConfig, ToolResponse } from '../types'
   import { PineconeParams, PineconeResponse } from './types'

   export const fetchTool: ToolConfig<PineconeParams, PineconeResponse> = {
     id: 'pinecone_fetch', // Follow the {provider}_{tool_name} format
     name: 'Pinecone Fetch',
     description: 'Fetch vectors from Pinecone database',
     version: '1.0.0',

     // OAuth configuration (if applicable)
     provider: 'pinecone', // ID of the OAuth provider

     params: {
       // Tool parameters
     },
     request: {
       // Request configuration
     },
     transformResponse: async (response: Response) => {
       // Transform response
     },
     transformError: (error) => {
       // Handle errors
     },
   }
   ```

6. **Register Your Tool:**  
   Update the tools registry in `/sim/tools/index.ts` to include your new tool:

   ```typescript:/sim/tools/index.ts
   import { fetchTool, generateEmbeddingsTool, searchTextTool } from './pinecone'
   // ... other imports

   export const tools: Record<string, ToolConfig> = {
     // ... existing tools
     pinecone_fetch: fetchTool,
     pinecone_generate_embeddings: generateEmbeddingsTool,
     pinecone_search_text: searchTextTool,
   }
   ```

7. **Test Your Tool:**  
   Ensure that your tool functions correctly by making test requests and verifying the responses.

### Naming Conventions

Maintaining consistent naming across the codebase is critical for auto-generation of tools and documentation. Follow these naming guidelines:

- **Block Files:** Name should match the provider (e.g., `pinecone.ts`)
- **Block Export:** Should be named `{Provider}Block` (e.g., `PineconeBlock`)
- **Icons:** Should be named `{Provider}Icon` (e.g., `PineconeIcon`)
- **Tool Directories:** Should match the provider name (e.g., `/tools/pinecone/`)
- **Tool Files:** Should be named after their function (e.g., `fetch.ts`, `search_text.ts`)
- **Tool Exports:** Should be named `{toolName}Tool` (e.g., `fetchTool`)
- **Tool IDs:** Should follow the format `{provider}_{tool_name}` (e.g., `pinecone_fetch`)

### Guidelines & Best Practices

- **Code Style:** Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations. Use meaningful variable names and small, focused functions.
- **Documentation:** Clearly document the purpose, inputs, outputs, and any special behavior for your block/tool.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and provide user-friendly error messages.
- **Testing:** Add unit or integration tests to verify your changes when possible.
- **Commit Changes:** Update all related components and registries, and describe your changes in your pull request.

Happy coding!
